                    Just before the Toss in the Edgbaston series opener of 2018, Ravi Shastri had found himself in the company of Michael Holding. During the brief conversation that ensued, India's head coach was spotted pointing at the dark clouds above, suggesting the new ball would do quite a bit to start. As England chugged along to 98 for 1 after opting to bat, Holding revealed tid-bits of this chat. "I told him not to be fooled by the clouds, the pitch is dry." India fought admirably thereafter but it was a revelation that they had begun yet another overseas assignment on the backfoot.

                    <p>
                        When: England vs India, 1st Test, August 4-8 2021, 11:00 Local, 15:30 IST

                        Where: Trent Bridge, Nottingham

                        What to expect: After a cloudy opening day, there is rain on the forecast radar from Days 2-5 and teams are likely to be in for a start-stop contest. Nottingham's own, Stuart Broad, suggests Trent Bridge is currently home to the best first-class pitches in the country. "There's been bounce, carry and slips have been in the game," he said. The statistics offer better insight. The last three first-class games at the venue have all resulted in innings wins for the home side with defending County Champions Essex's second-innings 194, the highest achieved by a visiting team.
